### Deep Learning Models for Agricultural Data Analysis

This repository contains deep learning models trained on 50 years of agricultural data for India. The models included are:

1. **Fertilizer Suggestor**
2. **Rain Predictor**
3. **Temperature Predictor**

These models are designed to provide insights and predictions for agricultural practices based on historical data.

#### Files Included:

- **models.py**: Python file containing the implementation of the deep learning models.
- **.pth**: File containing the trained weights for each model.
- **.csv**: File containing the data files used to train the models.

## Model Descriptions

### Fertilizer Suggestor:
This model predicts the optimal type and quantity of fertilizer to be used based on soil conditions, crop type, and other relevant factors.

### Rain Predictor:
Predicts the probability of rainfall in a given region, helping farmers plan irrigation and other agricultural activities accordingly.

### Temperature Predictor:
Predicts the temperature trends, enabling farmers to anticipate climate conditions and take appropriate measures.

## Data

The data used to train these models are available in the same directory. These datasets cover various aspects of agricultural conditions in India over the past 50 years.
